Problem Description-

For an integer sequence a=[a1,a2,…,an], we define f(a) as the length of the longest subsequence∗ of a that is a palindrome†

.

Let g(a)
represent the number of subsequences of length f(a) that are palindromes. In other words, g(a) counts the number of palindromic subsequences in a

that have the maximum length.

Given an integer n
, your task is to find any sequence a of n

integers that satisfies the following conditions:

    1≤ai≤n

for all 1≤i≤n
.
g(a)>n

It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.

∗
A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained from y

by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

†
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, [1,2,1,3,1,2,1], [5,5,5,5], and [4,3,3,4] are palindromes, while [1,2] and [2,3,3,3,3]

are not.
Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
(1≤t≤100

). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
(6≤n≤100

) — the length of the sequence.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n

over all test cases.
Output

For each test case, output n
integers a1,a2,…,an

, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

Note

In the first example, one possible solution is a=[1,1,2,3,1,2]
. In this case, f(a)=3 as the longest palindromic subsequence has length 3. There are 7 ways to choose a subsequence of length 3

that is a palindrome, as shown below:

    [a1,a2,a5]=[1,1,1]

[a1,a3,a5]=[1,2,1]
[a1,a4,a5]=[1,3,1]
[a2,a3,a5]=[1,2,1]
[a2,a4,a5]=[1,3,1]
[a3,a4,a6]=[2,3,2]
[a3,a5,a6]=[2,1,2]

Therefore, g(a)=7
, which is greater than n=6. Hence, a=[1,1,2,3,1,2]

is a valid solution.

In the second example, one possible solution is a=[7,3,3,7,5,3,7,7,3]
. In this case, f(a)=5. There are 24 ways to choose a subsequence of length 5 that is a palindrome. Some examples are [a2,a4,a5,a8,a9]=[3,7,5,7,3] and [a1,a4,a6,a7,a8]=[7,7,3,7,7]. Therefore, g(a)=24, which is greater than n=9. Hence, a=[7,3,3,7,5,3,7,7,3] is a valid solution.


Solution-

What I did here is that, to make the count of longest palindromic subsequences of length n greater than n. Simply write down numbers from 1 to n-2 and then add two 1s at last.
This would result in 2n-4 plaindromic subsequences of length 3.
Now, n-2+n-2>n for n>4 which satisfies the problem constraint as n>=6.

Code-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class palindromic_subsequences {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int t=sc.nextInt();
        while(t-->0){
            int n=sc.nextInt();
            for(int i=1;i<=n-2;i++){
                System.out.print(i+" ");
            }
            System.out.print(1+" "+1);

            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
